# RADAR
This is a model which determines the objects, with respect to its angle and a few mathematical constraints. It detects the object through the IR sensor and forwards the received signals (input) through the Arduino UNO micro-controller board. The Application will be executed and result is produced in the Processing3 Application.

Radar (RAdio Detection And Ranging) is a detection system that
uses radio waves to determine the distance (ranging), angle, and radial
velocity of objects relative to the site. It can be used to detect aircraft,
ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and
terrain. A Radar System consists of a transmitter producing
electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting
antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for
transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine
properties of the object(s). Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the
transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving
information about the object's location and speed.
